## 🔍 What I Do

- Build **production‑grade AI systems**: scalable ML pipelines, agent orchestration, and RAG architectures  
- Lead the design and development of **Ragprod** — a retrieval-augmented generation system built for real-world applications  
- Bring **scientific rigor** from my drug-discovery background: fragment screening, graph-based molecular modeling, virtual screening  
- Expose models and agents via **FastAPI**, Dockerize for portability, and scale with **AWS**  
- Explore **multi-agent workflows** using LangGraph / LangChain to enable reasoning, decision-making & automation

## ⚡ Fun / Personal

- 🎧 When I’m not writing code: I read about structural biology, play chess, and binge sci-fi.  
- 🧪 Always in learning mode: currently diving into **agent orchestration**, **vector‑store embeddings**, and **bio‑AI integrations**.  
- 💬 Fun fact: I sometimes talk to my code. It rarely answers back — but when it does, it's usually an error message.
