## 🔬 My Core Expertise

- **Drug Discovery**: Computational pipelines, fragment-based screening, cheminformatics  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: I’m currently working on **Ragprod**, a RAG-based system to enable … *(describe what Ragprod does — retrieval, agents, production, etc.)*  
- **AI Orchestration**: Multi-agent workflows, LangGraph, automated reasoning  
- **ML in Production**: FastAPI, Docker, scalable pipelines, embedding databases
